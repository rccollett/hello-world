      <h4>This is the start of my learnings.</h4>
  </head>
  <p>I'm ready to start a new chapter of my life. One that is actually interesting and fulfilling to me.</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>What I would like to accomplish</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Basic Understanding of HTML</li>
      <li>Learnings of CSS</li>
      <li>Eventually a career that relies on myself</li>
      </ul>
      </ul>
      </p>
<p>It's going to be <i>really</i> difficult and time cosuming. But I need this and want this.</p>
